A2: Guidelines  
✔	Synonyms not supported in MySQL. Required to include example from oracle in write-up or we can use Alice name for table name in query.  
✔	Sequence should be implemented with AUTO_INCREMENT. Concept of sequence from oracle must be included in the write-up.  
✔	Simple view, Index (simple, unique, composite and text – show index after creation)
